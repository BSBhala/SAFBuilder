SimpleArchiveFormat Builder
===========================

A standalone Java tool to build Simple Archive Format packages which are used to easily ingest items into a document management system, such as an institutional repository like DSpace. The use case satisfied by this SAFBuilder is that someone has a spreadsheet filled with metadata as well as content files such as images and PDFs and wishes to then bulk import this into a document management system. Users find it easy to create spreadsheets, this tool makes it easy to then import it into their system.

Instructions
------------
The commands below will: check out the code from Git, download the external java libraries used to make the tool, compile the source code, and execute it. The exact commands below are specific to Linux, other users should be able to deduce what it means.
    git clone git://github.com/peterdietz/SAFBuilder.git
    cd SAFBuilder
    mvn clean package
    ./safbuilder.sh

With no arguments the system will print out the help.
> USAGE: BatchProcess /path/to/directory metadatafilename.csv  
> Hint -- directory: Use absolute path and no trailing slashes  
> Hint -- metadatafilename: needs to be in the directory, as do the content files  

Included is some sample data to get started using the tool.
    ./safbuilder src/sample_data AAA_batch-metadata.csv

The output is a directory "SimpleArchiveFormat" in the directory you previously specified.
There will also be some on-screen text, usually indicating what it encountered.
